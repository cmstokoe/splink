        # 'begin by choosing for each vertex (node) a representatative by
        # picking the vertex with the minimum id amongst itself and its neighbours'

        # i.e. attach neighbours to nodes and find the minumum
        # Note that, since the edges always have the lower id on the left hand side
        # we only need to join on unique_id_r, and pick unique_id_l

        # That is to say, we only bother to find neighbours that are
        # smaller than the node

        # i.e if we want to get the neighbours of node D, we don't need to get both
        # D->C and D->E, we only need to bother getting D->C, because we know in advance
        # this will have a lower minimum that D->E

        # https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09478.pdf
        # 'then to improve on that representation by taking the minimum ID amongst
        # the representatives of the vertex and all its neighbours'

        # This time we want:
        # To get all the neighbours of each node
        # For each neighbour, get its representative (the neigbour's representative)
        # For each node_id, to compute its new representative
        # use the minimum of the neighbours' representatives

        # Note that in this case, we want to get all neighbours of each node
        # IN BOTH DIRECTIONS (hence the union)

        # i.e. we want to retreieve all neighbours
        # EITHER SMALLER OR GREATER, and get THEIR representative

        # For example, supposing we have an edge C -> D.  It may be the case that the
        # representative of D is A.  So we want to retreieve C->D even though D
        # is greater than C, because D's representative may be less than C.

        # >> Get all the neighbours of C,

        # >> This time join on not the edges, but the result of the above query

        # Generate a table that records ALL neighbours for each node -
        # this includes circular connections (i.e. A->A), as well as
        # current connections and the reverse of these connections
        # (i.e. A->B and B->A would both be included in our representation).

        # connection is null when we apply our joins.
