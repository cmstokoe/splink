            Code summary:

            The "r" table is the "representatives" table:
            This utilises our neighbours table and our known representatives.

            The idea is that we join on the representative for all
            known neighbours of a specific node. So if we know that
            (A->B and B->C), then on a subsequent iteration we can
            infer that (A->C) by joining on B.

            To speed up the code, we use a breakdown named "rep_match",
            which takes a boolean value and indicates whether there a
            match on the current and previous representative for the node.

            This tells us if the node has reached its final
            representative, by checking to see if any links have taken
            place. By filtering on this, we can skip nodes that have
            already been fully connected to a "base node".

            The final select statement creates this "rep_match" by
            joining on the previous representative of the node and
            comparing it to the current representative.

            This "rep_match" also in turn becomes our exit condition
            for our "while" loop.

            In short, where every node's representative has stopped changing,
            we can exit the loop.
